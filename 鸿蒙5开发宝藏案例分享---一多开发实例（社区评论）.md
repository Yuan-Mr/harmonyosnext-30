### 🌟【HarmonyOS Development Treasure Cases!】Practical Experience Sharing for Multi-Device Adaptation 🌟  

Hello everyone! While browsing HarmonyOS developer docs today, I stumbled upon a "hidden treasure"—the official team has hidden超多super practical development cases! Especially the "community comment app" one-develop-multi-deploy example, which made me exclaim, "So this is how it's done?!" 😍 I must organize and share it with you, while breaking down several core cases step by step!  


### 📱 What's One-Develop-Multi-Deploy? In a nutshell:  
Develop once, auto-adapt to phones, tablets, and PCs! HarmonyOS's responsive layout and dynamic UI capabilities let different devices "shine" without writing multiple codebases—truly a godsend for developers!  


### 🛠️ Ultra-Practical Case Analysis (with Code!)  
#### 1️⃣ Hotspot Page Layout: Single Column to Waterfall Flow  
**Function**: Displays news in a vertical list on mobile, auto-switching to multi-column waterfall flow on tablets/PCs—the larger the screen, the richer the content!  
**Core Technology**:  
- List container + breakpoint control: Dynamically set column count (lanes attribute) based on screen width (`currentBreakpoint`).  
- Code highlight:  
```typescript  
// 1 column on mobile → 2 columns on tablet → 3 columns on PC  
List() {  
  ForEach(data, (item) => {  
    ListItem() { ... }  
    .width(new BreakpointType('100%', '50%', '33%').getValue(currentBreakpoint))  
  })  
}  
.lanes(3) // Maximum support for 3 columns  
.listDirection(Axis.Horizontal) // Horizontal arrangement  
```  
**Effect**: Clean on small screens, dense but non-wasteful on large screens! (Image: Mobile→Tablet→PC gradient diagram)  

#### 2️⃣ Dynamic Cards: Bring UI to Life  
**Function**: Displays single-column cards on mobile, auto-switching to dual-column waterfall flow on PC with adaptive spacing.  
**Black Technology**:  
- WaterFlow container: Dynamically set column count (`columnsTemplate`) based on device type.  
- Code snippet:  
```typescript  
WaterFlow() {  
  ForEach(cardData, (item) => {  
    FlowItem() {  
      CardView(item) // Custom card component  
    }  
  })  
}  
.columnsTemplate(currentBreakpoint === 'lg' ? '1fr 1fr' : '1fr') // Dual columns on PC  
```  
**Effect**: Dual-column cards on PC are tightly arranged for a super-smooth scrolling experience~  

#### 3️⃣ Watch-and-Comment: God-Level Left-Right Layout  
**Function**: News and comments are in a top-bottom layout on mobile, auto-changing to left-content-right-comments on PC for simultaneous reading.  
**Core Skills**:  
- Grid layout (GridRow/GridCol):  
  - Mobile: Content area occupies 12 grids, comments start a new row.  
  - PC: Content area occupies 8 grids, comments occupy 4 grids, side by side.  
- Code key points:  
```typescript  
GridRow({ columns: { sm: 12, lg: 12 }}) {  
  GridCol({ span: { sm: 12, lg: 8 }}) { /* Content area */ }  
  GridCol({ span: { sm: 12, lg: 4 }}) { /* Comment area */ }  
}  
```  
**Effect**: On PC, it's like Bilibili split-screen—watch videos while scrolling comments!  

#### 4️⃣ Interaction Easter Eggs: Two-Finger Zoom + Mouse/Keyboard Adaptation  
- **Two-finger zoom**: Use PinchGesture to listen for pinch gestures and adjust font size dynamically:  
```typescript  
.gesture(  
  PinchGesture()  
    .onActionUpdate((event) => {  
      this.fontSize = 14 * event.scale; // Adjust based on zoom ratio  
    })  
)  
```  
- **Mouse/touch distinction**: When clicking the comment area, mobile pops up the keyboard directly, while PC shows the input box:  
```typescript  
.onClick(() => {  
  if (isPC) showInputBox(); // PC logic  
  else popupKeyboard(); // Mobile logic  
})  
```  


### 💡 Practical Experience Summary  
1. **Leverage official Demos**: Cases in docs are best practice templates—just modify parameters for use!  
2. **Breakpoint judgment is core**: `currentBreakpoint` determines layout direction—clarify device types first!  
3. **Component reuse is king**: Extracting components like `HotListItemView` saves 80% duplicate code!  


### 🚀 Final Words:  
HarmonyOS "one-develop-multi-deploy" gets better with use! Especially when seeing one codebase run perfectly on phones, tablets, and PCs—the sense of achievement is unmatched~ Go try official cases and share pitfall experiences in the comments!
